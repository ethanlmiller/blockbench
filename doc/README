blockbench
==========

blockbench is a set of benchmarking tools for generating and measuring storage system
performance on block-based workloads.  There are three basic tools provided by this suite:

iofill: Quickly fills a volume with random data
ioload: Runs extensive tests on a volume

ioloadgen: More complex / feature-full load generator, capable of both fill and load on
           multiple volumes.

For more details on each of these tools, and on the distribution as a whole, please see
the latex / PDF files in the doc/ directory.
